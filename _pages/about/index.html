<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Greetings! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Lorenci. Currently, Iâ€™m pursuing my PhD at <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Open University</a> (UK) within the <a href="https://www5.open.ac.uk/stem/life-health-chemical-sciences/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">School of Life, Health, and Chemical Science</a>. My primary focus is on advancing research at the intersection of nanomaterials and biomedical applications. Specifically, Iâ€™m based at the <a href="https://www.iit.it/it/home" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Istituto Italiano di Tecnologia</a> (IT) where Iâ€™m involved in the <a href="https://nanobio.iit.it/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Nanomaterials for Biomedical Applications</a> department. Here, my work centers around the development of scalable methods for producing magnetic-inorganic nanomaterials tailored for applications in cancer theragnostics and other biomedical areas.</p> <p>My academic journey began with a Master of Science degree in Chemistry, which I obtained from the <a href="https://fshn.edu.al/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Uni of Tirana</a> (AL) and the <a href="https://www.fkkt.um.si/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Uni of Maribor</a> (SI). Additionally, I had the opportunity to visit through a Short-Term-Scientific Mobility, The Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry at the <a href="https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/fachrichtung/pharmazie.html" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Uni of Saarland</a> (DE), where I focused on the bioactivity of different medicinal plant extractions.</p> <p>Prior to embarking on my doctoral studies, I accumulated experience working in various research and industry settings. For five years, I was part of the Research Department at <a href="https://ivodent.edu.al/research" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ivodent Academy</a> (AL) where I engaged in diverse projects spanning high-pressure applications, medical and aromatic plant extraction studies, and thermal characterization of inorganic materials. Furthermore, I gained practical experience as a product technologist for the <a href="https://krijon.al/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">distributor</a> of leading scientific equipment brands such as Netzch, Sartorius, Bruker, Memmert, and Thermofischer in Albania.</p> <p>Beyond my research endeavors, I am deeply interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence and public health solutions, particularly in the context of open-access initiatives. I also have a keen interest in visualizing and analyzing big data, drawing insights from human psychology, and exploring the tenets of stoic philosophy.</p> <p>If youâ€™d like to discuss potential collaborations or delve deeper into any of these areas, Iâ€™d love to connect! Feel free to reach out anytime.</p> <p>Farewell!</p> </body></html>
